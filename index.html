		<h1>Pair Programming</h1>

		<p>
			Pair programming is when two programers write code together using one keyboard. There are some different ways to do "pairing" however in general there are two roles, the driver and the
			navigator. The driver has the keyboard and writes the actual code, the navigator reviews the code as it is typed and contributes ideas and improvments. Pair programming should be highly social
			and interactive and the main idea is to generate higher quality code as well as sharing knowledge.
